This is a fork of the [Havoc](https://github.com/furrtek/portapack-havoc/) firmware, which itself was a fork of the [PortaPack](https://github.com/sharebrained/portapack-hackrf) firmware, an add-on for the [HackRF](http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/). A fork is a derivate, in this case one that has extra features and fixes when compared to the older versions.

# OBJECTIVE: BLACKOUT

This version of portapack is going to attempt to focus on the details that haven't been ironed out yet. I'm doing it 'on my own' because I'm old and dont know how this stuff works. ;) I will likely just do pulls or something, but for now I wanted to play in a sandbox. You're welcome to watch.

Don't expect much.
I'm not.
;)
